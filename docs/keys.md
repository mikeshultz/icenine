# Key File Management

TBD

- Key file are stored in `~/.web3/keystore` in files with a unique UUID for a name
- Files are stored according to the [Secret Storage Definition](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition).  They are encrypted with the password that was provided.  **Loss of this password will render these keyfiles useless!**
- These files should be compatible with storage from most other clients, and Icenine should be able to open them(needs testing!)
- **These files SHOULD be backed up!**
- **I am not liable for your mistakes!  Or mine for that matter!  No warranty!  Use at your own risk!**
